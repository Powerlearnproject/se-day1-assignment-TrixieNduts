#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is a branch of computer science thats involved in designing, developing,t esting and maintanance of software applications. software enginners apply engineering principles and programming language knowledge to build end user software solotions.
software enginering enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

face recognition this is mostlty used by law enforcements to identify criminals 
social apps like facebook, instagram, TikTok and X this are some of the social spaces that people form allover the world can link up and chat has made communication very easy.
meeting spaces like Zoom and Google meets has made working easier, as on can make official meetings from anywhere anytime as long as you have internet connection.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning- this involves defining the software purpose and scope.
requirements- this involves identifying and recording precise requirements of the end user.
design- this involves building a framework
software development- this involves converting the software design into tangible code.
testing- testing involves a thorough examination of the software for any bugs or glitches that might have slipped through during coding
deployment- here we present it to the users by pushing to the production environment
maintenance- the goal is to adapt to the softwareâ€™s changing needs

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is ideal if a project has stable and clearly defined requirements that are unlikely to change and has a timeline while Agile is considered when requirements are unclear or expected to evolve has no timeline.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software developer is responsible for writing the code and developing the entire software product, a Quality Assurance Engineer designs test plans, scenarios, scripts, or procedures and  a Project Manager oversees the entire software development process, from initial planning and design to developing and testing technical aspects of the system and timely completion. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently, an example is visual studio code.
Version control systems streamline development processes, enabling faster iteration and delivery of features, an example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Lack of Workflow Visibility - Invest in tools that empower the teams to make data-driven decisions.
Lack of Predictability In Software Delivery - Minimize external dependability, especially, avoid getting locked in the cloud.
Problems With Development Velocity - Early detection and fixing of bugs saving time and effort later


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing is the most basic type of testing done by the developers before handing the software/product to the testing team.
Integration testing is a type of software testing in which individual software components are tested as a group.
System testing is software testing in which all components are tested together to ensure that the final product meets the specified requirements.
Acceptance testing is a type of software testing that determines whether or not the software should be released to the public.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt and it enhances the user-AI interaction so the AI understands the user's intention even with minimal input.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Give me a recipe of a cake.
Give me a recipe of a chocolate cake.
Be as Specific and Detailed as Possible
